IMPORTANTE NOTE - Monday 28/08/17 : Unfortunately, my disponibility doesn't allow me to update and fix issues of this plugin. Updates will be rare, as like fixes (But the project isn't abandoned. I make updates when I get more times). Source code remains accessible and I would continue to accept "Pull Request" and commits them to the master branch. I thank, in advance, all the people who participate in the source code to make the plugin better.
